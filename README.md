CV Final Project

A note on data: We were not able to provide our original training or testing data, as githib has file-size limits of 25mb, and even our zip files were larger than that. Instead, we've provided some short test data in the data folder for you to evaluate our models on.

To run YOLO11:

Run each cell in ../CV_FINAL_PROJECT_SP25/yolo/CV_project.ipynb, with the exception of the training cell, as we've already provided the fully trained model for you. Besure to update the datapaths so that they correspond with your machine.
